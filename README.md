Markdown Extra Viewer
=====================

This is a redmine plugin to support Markdown Extra for repository viewer.
This is a modified version which uses [RDiscount](https://github.com/rtomayko/rdiscount/) instead of [BlueFeather](http://ruby.morphball.net/bluefeather/) for processing markdown.

Requirements
------------

* [RDiscount](https://github.com/rtomayko/rdiscount/)

Installation
------------

    % gem install rdiscount
    % script/plugin install git://github.com/hnakamur/redmine_markdown_extra_viewer.git

License
-------
GPLv2. see LICENSE file.

Because the license of the original [Markdown Extra Viewer](https://github.com/tmtm/redmine_markdown_extra_viewer) is GPLv2, which I confirmed [TOMITA Masahiro](https://github.com/tmtm) with mail, it must be GPL.
